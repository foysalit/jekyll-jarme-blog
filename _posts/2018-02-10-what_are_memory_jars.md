**Memory jars** are best ways to group your memories in different categories. Going to an event? vacationing in hawai? Planning your wedding? create a jar and put your memories related to those events in their own jars. 

JarMe Premium members can export their jars into `.pdf` file format which can then be printed out as a diary/notebook.

To quickly show you how we use jars to keep our own memories we made a short video. Enjoy:
