Places in Jarme App is a section found in the menu. In places you will be able to get an overview of all the places you have memories in.

You may also come across ***google hitmap*** which are colored red, yellow and blue. ***Red*** represents the area you have most locations in, ***blue*** shows the area you have the least locations in and ***yellow*** shows locations in between red and blue.

Now if you click on the location icon on the top right corner, you will be able to go through all the locations you have added in your memories to this date. They are categories from ***most used location to least used*** locations. You will also be able to see ***when*** that location was first created and the ***number of memories*** you have in that location.
