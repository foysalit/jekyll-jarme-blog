JarMuseum is a feature we implemented to remind users of the memories they created in the past. Currently, any memories created more than 3 months ago will be featured on your memory lane page. That is considering you did create a memory today three months ago or before.

For example, today is ***07th February 2018*** JarMuseum checks for the oldest memory you have created on ***7th*** of ***any month*** but has to be at least 3 months old.

However you may have multiple memories created on ***7th.*** So JarMuseum looks for the oldest memory created on ***7th*** of ***any month*** and features that on your memory lane page.

***How to turn on JarMuseum?***

> ***Step 1.*** Open the app and click on the menu on the top left corner. 

> ***Step 2.*** Click on setting found on the Menu

> ***Step 3.*** Click on Notifications from the list

> ***Step 4.*** From here you turn on both ***"In app notification"*** and ***"push notification"*** depending on your preference.

- **In app notification:**  Turning this on will allow users to view the memory within the app. The memory will be featured on the memory lane page.

- **Push notification:** You will receive a notification on your phone reminding you that you have memories in your JarMuseum created today. Click on the notification to view all the memories. 

## *Why was JarMuseum made this way?*
Our initial plan was to show users the memory of the day happening a year ago. So suppose if today was ***7th February 2018*** and you had a memory on ***7th February 2017*** then JarMuseum would show that memory on your memory lane page. And if nothing happened today a year ago, it would show nothing. But since users have to use Jarme App for a year to use this cool feature, we have reduced it down to 3 months ***for now***.

## *What's the future of JarMuseum?*
Once we get a lot of users using Jarme App and they are using it for more than a year, we will change the current setting to ***"memory of the day"*** where users can only view what happened today a year ago.
