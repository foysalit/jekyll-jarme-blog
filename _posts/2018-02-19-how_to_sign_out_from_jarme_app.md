A memory can be deleted from Jarme App by following the steps below:

***Step 1.*** Hold down the icon of the memory until the memory **fades** out. 

***Step 2.*** Click on the **delete icon** on the top right corner.

***Step 3.*** A final **popup** will show asking if you are sure you would like to remove the memories. Click **remove** to delete your memory.

You can also:
- Delete **multiple memories** by tapping anywhere on the other memories once clicked on the icon. 
- See the **number of memories** you have selected to delete on the top left corner.

> Note: Memory delete is **permanent** at the moment. Once the memory is deleted you won't to able to restore it.
