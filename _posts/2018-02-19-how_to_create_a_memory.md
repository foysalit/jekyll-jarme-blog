A new memory on Jarme App can be added by clicking on **write a memory** on the memory lane page.

***What information is mandatory to create a memory?***
- Only the title!

***BUT what more can you add to your memory?***

**✎ A description section.** An unlimited text input allowing you to write down every single detail of your memory. 

**♥ Favorite.** Is there a memory that you absolutely love and adore? Well now you put it in your favorite.

**ᛩ Location.** Add a location to remember where you made your memory. 

**☀ Weather.** Weather will be automatically added to your memory when a location is used but ONLY if you add the location before saving the memory for the first time. If you come back, edit the memory and put a location on it then unfortunately it won't work.  

**✤ Color.** Change from 24 different colors to paint your memory. Add different colors to make your memory lane look more beautiful, bright and radiant. 

**✈ Icons.** Symbolise your memory using icons (e.g. plane for traveling) so that if you are not bothered to read your memory title or description then you can just scan through the icons to get an idea of what the memories are about. 

**📷 Images.** For now you can add only one image to your memory but we will let your add more in the near feature. 

**⬓ Jars.** Group your memories into different Categories. 

**❶❼ Date/Time.** Remember exactly what time and date your memory occurred.

**► Voice record.** Add as many recording as you like to each of your memories. 

> **Tip 1:** If you aren't bothered to change the color and icon of your memory every time you add a event then choose a default color and icon from ***Menu>Settings>Account.*** 

> **Tip 2:** You can add an ***image***, a ***location*** and an ***icon*** to your memory ***directly*** from the memory lane page.
