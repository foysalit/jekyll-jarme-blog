You can view personal statistics from Menu>settings>personal statiscs

Once you are on the personal statistics page, there will be a graph demonstrating total memories of each month in the current year. The total count of memories each month can be viewed by clicking on pink circles. Memories from past years can also be viewed using the yearly filter on top right corner of the personal statistis page. 

The most used icons of the year can also be viewed from the statistics page.
