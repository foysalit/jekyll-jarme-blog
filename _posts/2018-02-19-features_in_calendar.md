The Calendar in Jarme App gives you a comprehensive review of your monthly Jarme usage. But that's not all you can do from calendar.

## *Add a memory directly from the Calendar*

You can **ONLY** add a memory from the calendar if the date does not have a memory at all.

Now follow the instructions below to add a memory from the calendar:
> ***Step 1:*** Open the app and click on the menu which is on the top left corner.

> ***Step 2:*** Click on Calendar from the menu

> ***Step 3:*** Click on any of the dates that is "faded out" and does not have a "dot" underneath it.

> ***Step 4:*** Choose add memory from the pop up window.

> ***Step 5:*** Add details to your memory and click on the "right icon" on top right corner.

***Why add a memory from the Calendar?*** 

Adding a memory from the calendar will automatically select the date for your memory so you won't have to change the date manually, which would be the case if you were adding the memory from the memory lane page.

## *Calendar Filter* 
View memories of previous months by selecting **month** and **year** through the calendar filter.
