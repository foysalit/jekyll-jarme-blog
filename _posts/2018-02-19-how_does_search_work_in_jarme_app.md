The search engine of Jarme App is one of the smartest and advanced features we built that allows you to not only search using keywords but also lets you filter through memories.

You don't necessarily have to search a keyword on search engine unless you want to. Instead you can look for memories that are suppose your ***"favorite"*** memories or your memories with ***"favorite + pictures".*** How about memories with only ***locations?*** or specific ***"icon"*** or a certain ***"Jar"***? Or how about a memory that isn't **favorite** but has a **picture, location a specific icon and jar?**

It's all possible by Jarme App. Just decide what you would like to search for, select your filter and Jarme will do the rest for you. You can also search for a keyword and utilize the filter too in order to minimize the search result.
