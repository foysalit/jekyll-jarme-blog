**Ciao everyone!** 

While the community of our paid users are growing, we figured there are still a few users that are unhappy about our pricing system.

The pricing of Jarme has been released very recently and we are still trying to figure out the suitable price for our users. 

Even though $30 a year may sound very expensive to some users considering the amount of feature we are providing and its a **ONCE-OFF** payment, we believe our price is reasonable.

After doing some research we have **compared** a few other diary platforms with Jarme that should give you an idea why we believe Jarme should cost $30/year.
