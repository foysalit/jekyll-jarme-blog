**Absolutely YES!**

Is there a memory you would like to add to Jarme but don't have the internet connection? You can use Jarme App offline. Simply add your memory like you normally would and once you are back online we will automatically add the memories in your jar.

> ***Tips:** If for certain reason the memory does not upload or sync, please force upload the memory using the sync option which will be found on the top right corner of the memory lane page.*
