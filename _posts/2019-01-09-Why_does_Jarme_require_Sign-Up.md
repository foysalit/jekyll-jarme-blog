In order to use Jarme, we ask users to register with an email address. Now a few users have been asking why do we require a Sign-Up when platform such as Diaro or Journey does not require Sign-Up at all. Among many others, following 4 are the major issues that we are solving by asking you to **register** on our platform before using Jarme: 

## Issue 1: Storage Space

Platforms such as Diaro & Journey lets you save your memories on your device, which means your memories will be saved on your device **ONLY.** So lets say you used DIaro for 6 months and due to unfortunate events you **lost your phone or your phone doesn’t work anymore** you will loose all your memories that you have been saving for the past 6 months. **BOOM! GONE!** 

So how do they overcome that? They ask you to backup your data on Google Drive or Dropbox. Now Google drive gives you 15gb of free storage and dropbox gives you 2gb. So if you are adding a lot of data such as images to your memories on the diary then these cloud spaces are going to run out real fast. 

## Issue 2: Sync between multiple devices

Since your data is local, you would not be able to use any other platforms the app provides. Jarme has **web, desktop and tablet applications** and your memories will **sync** across all these platforms in realtime. Diaro provides a web version too and we assure you without signing in you would not get any of your data synced to your desktop version. 

## Issue 3: Moving between iOS and Android devices

So you have been using Android phone for so long you decided to give iPhone a try or vice versa. In order to take your data from android to iOS you would have to connect your Chosen app (e.g. diaro) to Dropbox, then take backup and then import all your data to iOS device. 

In order to sync between devices or even to take backups, diary apps usually require you to pay for their subscription plans. If you don’t have enough space you will also be required to pay for google drive or dropbox in order to take backup of your data. 

## Issue 4: Advanced search

Mobile devices these days are fast but burdening your device with complex data manipulation, indexing etc. is not a good idea. Which is why platforms like Diaro or Journey won’t let you filter your data with deep and advanced search. By creating an account and associating your data to your account index your data securely and by doing that, we can allow you to run advanced search harnessing the power of our servers where your data is stored instead of cluttering up your phone’s performance.

**We solved ALL of the above issues by simply asking our users to register on our platform. It takes half a minute and keeps your data safe and stored in our cloud storage, it allows you to change your devices easily & use web and desktop version without any hassle.** 

If you still have concerns regarding sign-in please do get in touch with us by emailing at: **[jarmeapp@gmail.com](mailto:jarmeapp@gmail.com)**

Thank you
