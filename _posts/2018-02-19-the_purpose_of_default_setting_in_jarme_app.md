Currently Jarme has two default options: Icon and color. 

## *What's the purpose of default color?*
Diaries can get boring at times due to many reasons but we believe one of the reason could be the lack of colors or brightness. Now while a lot of people prefer blunt and subtle colors, a few of us actually do like looking at shiny and bright elements.

Which is why Jarme has 24 different colors to choose from. **BUT** the colors aren't like themes. Changing the color does not change the whole interface of the app. It changes the elements of the memory itself.

However, changing color each time you create a memory can be time-consuming and sometimes annoying too. Which is why we gave you the option to choose a default color **[Menu>Settings>Account setting> Default color]**. Unless you prefer to chose a different color each time you create an event, the default color will always be the color of your memory.

## *What about default icon?*

Similar to default color, the purpose of default icon is to reduce the extra effort to create a memory. Setting one unique icon as default for all the memories means you won't have to change the ***"color"*** and the ***"icon"*** each time you create a memory.

## *What more is coming as default?*

Setting a default ***location*** and a default ***Jar*** might be something we will release in the future. But no promises.
